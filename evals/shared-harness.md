# Shared benchmark evals

This repo participates in the shared Skill Eval Harness:

- Repo: https://github.com/adewale/skill-eval-harness
- Version: `>=0.3.0`
- Manifest: `evals/shared-benchmark.json`

Install the harness from GitHub with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/adewale/skill-eval-harness.git@v0.3.0
```

Splits:
- `tune` — visible iteration cases.
- `holdout` — hidden end-of-round / merge scoring cases.
- `holdback` — examples withheld from `SKILL.md`, references, docs, and public eval descriptions until after scoring.

Validate from this repo root:

```sh
skill-benchmark validate evals/shared-benchmark.json
```

### In-repo leakage lint (no network)

The harness's prompt/assertion leakage check is also reimplemented in-repo so it
can run without cloning the harness (e.g. in CI / sandboxed runs):

```sh
npm run leak-lint   # node tools/leakage-lint.mjs
```

It flags assertion match-values that echo the case prompt verbatim (a Goodhart
hole — the assertion could pass by parroting the prompt). It exits non-zero on
any *unexpected* leak; intentional `contains_all` coverage/remediation checks
are allow-listed with a reason inside the script. This gate runs in
`.github/workflows/verify.yml`.

Prepare paired run tasks:

```sh
skill-benchmark prepare evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --out /tmp/slide-maker-tasks.jsonl
```

Include ablation variants when running a focused regression check:

```sh
skill-benchmark prepare evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --include-ablations --out /tmp/slide-maker-ablation-tasks.jsonl
```

Run autonomous Pi trigger checks for trigger/no-trigger cases:

```sh
skill-pi-trigger-eval evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --out /tmp/slide-maker-trigger-report.json
```

`old_skill` is optional and intentionally not emitted unless `old_skill_paths` is populated and `--include-old-skill` is passed. Hidden `holdout` / `holdback` prompt refs must be supplied privately before scoring; use `--allow-missing-prompts` only for dry-run planning.

Grade saved outputs:

```sh
skill-benchmark benchmark evals/shared-benchmark.json --runs eval-runs/latest --allow-scripts --out /tmp/slide-maker-benchmark.json
```

Run optional qualitative judges through the shared `judge` backend:

```sh
skill-benchmark judge evals/shared-benchmark.json --runs eval-runs/latest --judge-cmd 'claude -p' --transcripts eval-runs/judge-transcripts --out /tmp/slide-maker-judge-results.jsonl
skill-benchmark benchmark evals/shared-benchmark.json --runs eval-runs/latest --allow-scripts --judge-results /tmp/slide-maker-judge-results.jsonl --out /tmp/slide-maker-benchmark.json
```

Script assertions are deterministic repo-owned oracles and require `--allow-scripts` during grading.
